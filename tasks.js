let tasks = [];
tasks[0] = `Day 0


Please read this post completely - it contains all the guidelines of our journey.

This structure is 21 days and today is the initiation day!

✨ Day 0 - The creation of the group and intentions. ✨

Guidelines:

1. After the publication of the daily task, you have around 24 hours to complete it - make sure to have it done before bedtime.

2. When in the task you need to write something, the recommendation is to actually write by hand, with a pen on paper. It is ideal to have a separate notebook specifically for the 21 Days of Abundance.

3. Before you write, come to a calm state using slow deep breathing or meditation. The best time to complete the task is right after doing Deepak Chopra’s daily meditation.

4. Please send questions in private WhatsApp message to me 😊 No need to leave “thanks” or other comments apart from those instructed in the group chat.

5. Be fully focused on the daily task, allocate time and space for it.

6. If you cannot participate, or keep the rhythm of the program, please remove yourself from the group. Make this decision on your own. It is important for us to maintain the flow so that the energy input into this process does not dissipate.

7. After completing the daily task, please write the completion statement. For example, “Day 1 Done” etc. as a confirmation for all in the group. There will be days in which I will ask you to leave other comments. Feel free to include a message about what's opened up for you. Please do so in the same message so not to flood the chat with numerous messages that become a distraction.

8. If the task is not completed within the day (24 hours), please leave the group.

This is Deepak Chopra's program. I am only a conductor of information and intentions. 
The tasks are shared exactly as provided by the program.

Ultimately, the goal is to get to know yourself better, transform and clarify beliefs and attitudes.

Every day there will be a different task with a sentence to focus on for the day, and an audio file with an explanation and a Deepak Chopra meditation. 💗

REMINDERS:

If you have questions, please do not write them here, but send to me in a personal message.

This group is only for meditations, tasks and group energy concentration. Just in case, I recommend turning off notifications from this group.

Additionally this process can be  an opportunity to learn how to allocate time for yourself and your development every day. 

Good luck and Enjoy! ❤️

Today's Phrase:

✨ ”Starting today, I constantly attract abundance with my thoughts" ✨

I recommend writing the phrase in your notebook and return to it several times, the more the better.  
  
Mahatma Gandhi taught us that  our thoughts generate words, words generate actions, actions generate habits, habits generate character, and character breeds destiny.

If you have read and understood all the rules and agree to follow them, please write in the comment "Day 0 Done." This will be a test of the fact that we are on the same wavelength.

That's all for today.

Monday is the first day of our joint 21-day journey! 
I am so excited and honoured to be on this journey together! 

Enjoy the rest of your day. I'm happy that you are in this group with me. Much love! 💕😘`;

tasks[1] = `Day 1

Here we go! 🤩

I invite you to keep an open mind through this process  and structure as we go along. 😊

REMINDER: Please send any questions in a private message to me, not to this group. 

After you complete the task, please write: "Day 1 Done". 

No more writing is necessary or required.

You can leave the group if you decide not to continue at your discretion.

It is suggested that you have 24 hours to complete the task. 

Day 1 will be due by midnight Monday or within 24 hours from receiving this as we are in different time zones. 

I highly recommend doing the meditation and the task at the beginning of the day, if possible. It can have a profound effect on  the course of the day!

Day 1 Task:

In your new notebook, make a list of 50 people that have influenced your life.

They can be both living and already departed people, your relatives, friends, and celebrities, writers and personalities whom you do not necessarily know personally.

Everyone who has influenced you and contributed to your growth & development.

The list must have at least 50 names.

In the process of making a list, think about why you chose the person. What has changed in your life for the better? 

Move calmly and thoughtfully.  Remember the best things about each person in the list and what they bring into your life.

Trust in the process!

It is also recommend putting the phone in airplane mode at this time so that no one will interfere with you (children and everyone around you too, as much as it is realistic for you of course). 

Your list may be more than 50 people. But not less!

PHRASE OF THE DAY: 

 "Today I behold all the abundance that surrounds me."

This should also be written in your notebook and remembered during the day as often as possible.

Meditation

Meditation can be done before or after the task. It's up to you! 

This is the Mantra you will repeat mentally during the meditation:

So Ham
So Hamble

DAY 1 RECAP:

1. Meditation: repeat the mantra listening to the audio. 

2. Write the phrase of the day in your notebook: 

"Today I behold all the abundance that surrounds me."

Remember it during the day.

3. Complete the assignment in a notebook - make a list of 50 people who have influenced your development.

4. You have 24 hours to complete the task and the meditation. 

Enjoy your wonderful day! 💜`;

tasks[2] = `✨ Day 2 ✨

Welcome to the second day! I hope you're enjoying the flow so far!! 

Task:

It will seem simple to some people but not to others. 

Remember that if it is difficult for you to perform any task, then it is clear that there is a block - an obstacle in your mind on the path towards attaining abundance.

Be aware of this and STICK with it! Choose to continue and get the highest benefit of  the exercise for yourself.

Write all of your debts in your notebook. 

Debt on a bank account, credit cards, loans, debts to individuals, court debts - all of your debts, of any kind.

No need to record the amount, only to whom and for what.

For example: a mortgage, a car loan, a debt to VISA for a gift to Tanya, etc.

And after that, make a list of all your monthly payments. Again without numbers, just listing.

For example: renting an apartment, electricity, gas, council tax, water, an accountant, a kindergarten, a music tutor, a gym, a manicure, insurance, gasoline, etc.

Everything you have to pay each month should be recorded.

In general, create a complete list of sources of your monthly expenses, constant and changing.

For some, this list will be extensive.  Give yourself time to calmly walk through all the areas of your life in which you pay money. You may need to add what you remember even throughout the day.

Phrase 

Write the phrase of the day in your notebook:

“I create my personal abundance from an infinite source.”
 
Mantra

Answer the question: “What does abundance mean to me?” If you want, you can write the answer in your notebook.

May the energy of abundance of this beautiful group continue to grow and fill us all! 💜⭐`;

tasks[3] = `✨Day 3 - Mind, Matter and Spirit ✨

Welcome to the third day!
 
I hope this group and the daily exercises are inspiring and you are already seeing results! 

As you go through this process, keep your mind open and notice what's happening, co-incidences, new thoughts, insights, a different way of looking at a (stressful / annoying / irritating) situation. 

Please do feel free to message me directly with your experiences if you like, I'd love to hear it. 😊

Task

Draw notes, checks, stocks, bonds, coins and any other means of payment in your  notebook.

Draw enough to pay off all the debts and expenses you wrote down yesterday.  😉

Now you have complete freedom to create and draw a solution too if you're inclined. We draw in order to make it possible to pay for everything we need in the universe!

Use your imagination, your creativity and felt-tip pens, pencils or paints etc.

Draw bills, coins, wads of money, bags of money, rain of money - whatever you want! 🤑🍀💰💴💵💶💷💸💰

Remember, this is not about a drawing competition or lesson, but about allowing yourself to create your reality and let it manifest into your life.

While you are busy designing and even colouring, feel the satisfaction of creating a balance between debts and expenses and the means of payment that you create - as if it were a real payment of your expenses and debts.

Have fun with it! 😜🤗✨🍀

Phrase 

“Today I focus on what I want to attract into my life.”

After you complete the assignment, report in the group "Day 3 done" in 24 hours. 

Enjoy your beautiful day! 💜⭐`;

tasks[4] = `Day 4 - Pure Consciousness

Welcome to Day Four.

Remember that you will have 24 hours to complete the task. Please remember the guidelines shared in Day 0 and those of you unable to complete the tasks in a timely fashion please remove yourself from the group. This is a programme of abundance that we are building both for ourselves individually, and as a group and we need to keep the momentum. To support the structure, I will be removing participants who have not been able to maintain pace of this flow.

*Task*

Make a list of people whom you consider to be prosperous in your family or environment.

These are people you personally know and have access to. They have achieved their goals in life, all or in part, are happy, or are perceived by you as happy.

Important: We're not talking only about financial prosperity, the obligatory component is the joy, the happiness that this person is experiencing!

These can be people from the previous list. How many does not matter, even a few is enough.

Please remember, the more attention and reflection you give to these simple tasks, the greater the return. 

*Phrase* 

“From this moment forward, I invite unlimited abundance into my life.”

*Mantra*

Bonus - I encourage you to also answer the questions below in your notebook (or simply answer them yourself):

QUESTION #1: What does it mean to you to be immersed in pure consciousness?

QUESTION #2: How can you bring this awareness into your everyday life?

QUESTION #3: How has the practice of meditation helped you connect with your pure consciousness?

Have a great meditation and an abundant day. ⭐`;

tasks[5] = `✨ Day 5 - The Field of all possibilities ✨

Today is a good one AND an important development to our process so far.

💫 Message of the Day 💫
Today we will penetrate the field of all possibilities, appearing in the silence of meditation.

The unlimited power of the universe is always at Your disposal.

By making intuitive decisions rooted in this unified field, you can express your deepest desires.

By doing this, you will see how the field of all possibilities is widely revealed in front v of you to help your desires and dreams manifest and come true.

Phrase

"Today I embrace my potential to be, do and have whatever I can dream."

Mantra
Sat Chit Ananda

Task Intro

Today's task is based on the law of energy exchange.

A person constantly exchanges energy with other people.

The first principle of this law is that balance must be maintained in everything.

If someone departed, then someone arrived. 

If you sent something outside, then something will return to you.

If you want to achieve a balance in everything, learn to give and receive equally.

The Task

From today, you will be responsible for your own Abundance group. Even 2-3 people is enough, even at the very least one person!

Share this bot with them.

I openly described this as a “creative challenge” which I wanted to share with other interested and like-minded folk. 

Invite people from your contact list, people you know who may benefit, and even friends you haven't heard from for a while.

Seriously, take the step and invite everyone!  Do not decide for other people whether it will be interesting to them or not.

Perhaps it is this flow of plenty that they need now. And you will be the conductor of abundance in the lives of these people!

Only those who are ready to follow you and change their consciousness will remain in your group.

It so happens that usually the first to drop out are likely those of your friends who have a great lack of abundance in most things. As a result, you may really want to convince them to stay, but there is no need to persuade anyone. People are free to choose as they wish, remember this.

Remember, you will need to send meditations and tasks every day and make sure that only those who perform the task remain in the group, maintain the group guidelines and the general flow.

For some, this task may seem difficult due to the extra effort that will have to be made, or because of fear of failure, or fear of the unknown or the fear of "how it looks." 

It helps to realize one’s fears, doubts and limitations that interfere with growth.

Believe me, it's easy to lead your group and very inspiring! (It feels very expansive and naturally abundant 😉) 

You essentially need to copy the messages that I am sending you and check the progress of the tasks. You can at times add something from yourself if you like. 

Let the love in your hearts expand, because you can contribute to the well-being of others! 

Let me assure you, that it is normal to experience resistance, and an opportunity to ask yourself what are you making important?

The gift of this exercise is a gentle practice in simple leadership and non-attachment and letting go of what people think of you. Making a difference to those who need this on a soul level is more important. But letting them choose it or not without your judgement is important too.

Please know that it is normal to have resistance and have stuff come up, but what you make important is what really counts.

Allow yourself to complete this task and give out the energy of abundance, as it comes to you.
Even if you can lead one other person, you can experience the benefits of this exercise.

Also today there is no other written assignment, other than rewriting the phrase of the day in a notebook.

Tomorrow we will continue to work in the notebook.

Have a splendid day! 💜`;

tasks[6] = `Day 6 - The Seeds of Success 💫

Congratulations to all of you who have already created your own abundance groups! 💗 Sharing abundance is beautiful. 

Now we enter what's called Operating Mode ⭐

I recommend staying organised with your group and remaining timely. Observe the order and terms of assignments and use the original texts if you wish.

Remember that we only transmit what we have received ourselves.

If you have questions about the conduct of your group, please message me privately.

Task

"I, (full name, last name), am starting a new relationship with money today.

Money is good, pure, useful and necessary for my prosperity and growth, for my satisfaction and abundance.

Money brings positive things to my life. The success that I experience in life brings me money and happiness, for me and my loved ones.

I deserve to flourish and have a lot of money.

Money is my friend and the value of my investments in it is growing every day.

Success and money accompany me, here and now.

I ask my parents, grandparents, and ancestors to the very origins of the clan, who had difficulties due to lack of money, to bless me and give me permission to live differently.

And I ask my parents, grandparents, and ancestors to the very origins of the family, who lived in abundance and prosperity, to inspire me.”

Write this statement 10 times in your notebook by hand.

After that record yourself reading this statement with soul, expression and a deep sense of attachment, i.e.  sincerely, on audio or video. 

Our brain learns through repetition and rehearsal. Therefore, tune in to connect with what you will write.

This task is the longest in our journey!

It's recommended that before performing - to sit comfortably, relax, inhale several times slowly and deeply through the nose and exhale as slowly through the nose.

All of this is necessary to harmonize your internal relationship with money.

*Phrase*

"Everything I desire is within me!"

*Mantra of the Day*
Ram... Ram... Ram...

As a reminder, it is completely normal to experience discomfort and resistance to some tasks.

This journey WILL highlight your blocks and negative programming clearly so that you can see what is stopping you from living the abundant life that you desire. 

You have 24 hours – give or take – to complete this task. 

You all are doing amazing! 💗

Keep it up and have a wonderful day! 💜💫🌸`;

tasks[7] = `✨ Day 7 - Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire ✨

Now that you're wired for success, here is another powerful meditation and task! 

*Task*
 
Create a list of people that make you feel uncomfortable. 

This may include people from the list of the first day, i.e.  those who have pushed you to growth and have brought something meaningful to your life.

Here we are talking about the energy of discomfort.

It can be your relatives or people who are now far from you.

Your litmus test here is a feeling of discomfort - "I feel unpleasant."

Including if it is not a constant feeling of communicating with this person.

For example, it can be neighbors, employees, bosses, family members...

Remember that these people may trigger you, and at the same time, may also be your teachers or mentors!

*Phrase*

"I use my conscious intention to manifest my dreams."

tasks[8] = `✨ Day 8 - Abundance and the Law of Pure potentiality ✨

*Task*
Find at least 5 receipts of recent purchases. Write on each of them: "All that is invested is good and will return to itself seven times."

Receipts can be of any type: supermarket, restaurant, personal items, fuel, health, hairdresser, entertainment, etc. 

And from now on, on each purchase receipt that you receive, write this statement!

Remember, it’s important not only what you write, but also how you write it. 

Words have power. They help our mind build new programming and therefore create a new reality.

tasks[10] = `✨ Day 10 - Abundance and the Law of Karma ✨

*Task*
From yesterday, choose two from your list, perhaps the two that you feel limit you the most.

Establish a program for yourself by writing down at least two specific daily actions that can help you overcome those shortcomings and misbehaviours, reduce a deficiency, or recognise if there is a plus side to them and start using it in to your advantage. 

After that, immediately begin to fulfill the intent of your program. 

For example: If one of your shortcomings / flaws is being "ungrateful," you can establish a daily journaling of writing down all of what you are grateful for.

*Phrase*
“Today I make great choices because they are made with full awareness.“

Write the phrase of the day in a notebook and keep it in your mind, remembering and saying it as often as possible during the day.

It is a good idea to start as early as possible so that there is more opportunity to repeat the phrase of the day.

In addition, it is recommended that you listen to today's meditation a few times.

*Mantra*
Om Kriam Nama

*Message*
Abundance and the Law of Karma

In today's meditation, Deepak discusses the Law of Karma, or conscious decision-making, and we discover how, by making the right choices, we can bring much more good into our lives.

When you make any choice, you may ask yourself:

"How will this choice bring more happiness and more abundance to my life and those around me?"

Having asked this question, shift your attention to your heart, and be open to the answer that may immediately become clear.

By practicing conscious decision-making in this way, you will learn to observe your thoughts and make decisions that are more favorable to you.

Also write down the answers to the following questions in your notebook.

QUESTION No.1: How do you make decisions?

QUESTION No. 2: How have your decisions affected your life?
 
QUESTION No. 3: How can you make a more conscious choice?

Have a beautiful and productive day! 🤗`;

tasks[11] = `✨ Day 11 - Abundance and the Law of Least Effort ✨

In today's meditation, we will look at the Law of Least Effort and how it can support you in being unattached to the outcome of your deepest desires and intentions. 

When your actions are motivated by love, your energy is multiplied and accumulated.

The release of this energy allows you to redirect it and use it to create everything that you want to create.

When your spirit is your inner point of reference, all the power of love is at your disposal. And you can use this energy creatively, moving toward abundance and evolution.

Explore the following questions before beginning today's task:

•QUESTION No. 1: According to your conviction, how hard should you work to enjoy true abundance?

•QUESTION No. 2: In what areas of your life would you like to get more abundance?

•QUESTION No. 3: What changes should you make to release your desires into the space of universal consciousness - the source of all abundance?

*Task*
Please describe your Mother in your notebook.
•Positive aspects
•Limitations
•What did you learn from her?
•What aspects brought you closer together?
•What aspects separated you and created distance?

If your Mother is no longer in this world, focus on her image, join her and write what rises in your memory and feelings.

For some, this task will not be easy. If this is the case - while doing it, try to distance yourself from the personal experiences you've had with your Mother. See her as just a human, a Woman living her own life.

*Phrase*
”I expect and accept abundance to flow easily to me."

tasks[12] = `✨ Day 12 - Abundance and the Law of Intent and Desire ✨

*Message*
Attention energizes; intention transforms. In today's meditation, we will look at the Law of Intent and Desire.

Whatever you want or need in life can be programmed in the space “computer". It has unlimited organizing power to work for you, clearly articulating the intention and planting its seeds in the field of all possibilities.

Thus, you will attract the right people, as well as favorable situations and circumstances; which will help you in the manifestation and implementation of your desires.

QUESTION No. 1: What is your highest intention in life?

QUESTION No. 2: What can you do to make this happen? 

QUESTION No. 3: How will this intention best serve you and others?

*Task*
Ask your mom what her biggest pain / disappointment has been in her life.

And, what is her dream -
and/or great desire that remains unfulfilled?

Write the answer in your notebook.

If your mother is no longer with you or you are unable to ask her personally, go into a state of meditation, ask and listen to the answer. Write it down.

tasks[13] = `✨ Day 13 - Abundance and the Law of Detachment ✨

*Message*
Today we will learn how to relinquish the need to get a certain result. We will learn the Law of Detachment. 

Abundance comes in many forms. As long as you create through desires that benefit the whole world, you can get whatever you want.

Symbols of abundance are often in such things as a big house, a new car or elaborate jewelry that will bring waves of excitement into your life. But this does not mean sacrificing the ocean for the sake of several transient waves.

"Live, overflowing with an abundance of love, passion, creativity and significance, and then these symbols themselves will “chase” you."
Dr. David Simon, Co-Founder of the Chopra Center

QUESTION No. 1: What symbols of abundance do you dream of?

QUESTION No. 2: How could they improve both your life and others?

QUESTION No. 3: How else will such abundance positively affect your life? 

*Task*
Think about your Mother's description from Day 11.

Consider your life and your recurring patterns.

Do you see “copy-paste” situations or at least some similarities between you and your Mother?

What are they, how were they formed? 

Write these reflections in your notebook.

Listen to today's meditation, recommended a couple of times.

*Phrase*
"As I let go of the need to arrange my life, the Universe brings abundant good to me." 

"When I let go of the need to control and organize my life, the Universe brings in abundance for what I need."

*Message*
Abundance and the Law of Dharma

Today we are completing the second week of the 21 day meditation program of the Chopra Center - KEY TO ABUNDANCE.

Over the past week, we have examined abundance in terms of the principles described in the book, The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, from the Law of Pure Potentiality to the Law of Dharma.

When your life is full of true purpose, your dharma, or abundance, rushes toward you easily and effortlessly.

As the saying goes: “Do what you love, the money will follow.”

It is not only about material wealth, but also about satisfaction, confidence, optimism, joy and abundance! And all of it's manifestations that will come to you if you live your true purpose in life.

QUESTION No. 1: What brings you the most joy?

QUESTION No. 2: How do you feel this joy in your everyday life and in your current work?

QUESTION No. 3: How can you approach a life full of joy, by living your Dharma or life's dream?

*Task*
Enjoy this day, noticing the generous gifts of the world that surround you, seek you, and ask you to notice and accept them. Seek, find, accept and give thanks for each of them.

At the end of the day, write down at least three paths/ sources through which abundance has come to you today. Even if it was something very small.

Also watch this short video and think about the question that follows:

https://youtu.be/VVckUjjFYlM

Write down 3 cases when you deprived someone of the opportunity to learn his/her lesson.

Think of examples such as helping a friend, showing your power over others, etc.

tasks[15] = `✨ Day 15 - Living Synchrodestiny ✨

*Task*
Write a letter of gratitude and recognition to a person who you think hurt you at some point in life.

Meditate so that the image of this person comes to you.

More than one person may appear, however, today we write a letter to only one.

As you sit down to write, cleanse yourself of negative emotions towards this person. If you still have resentment or anger, you can separately write down all these feelings for them on paper and then burn or tear the sheet to shreds, often just noticing them can help a great deal.

It is important not to feel hostility towards a person when you write a letter of thanks to them.

Write this letter on a piece of paper. Writing by hand for this exercise is important!

Make a list of things that you wanted to do, but postponed. This could be because of other priorities or because of fear of hurting someone, or failing. Regardless of the reason, these are things that you still plan on doing. 

The idea of writing this list is to forgive yourself for everything that you have not yet done in your life.

For each line on your list, write a text of forgiveness based on examples below: 

•I, full name, forgive myself absolutely and lovingly for not graduating from university

By meditating and plunging into the awareness of the present moment, you understand that it is at this moment, everything is perfect and is what it should be.
And that any problems that you have are transient and temporary.

You reconnect with your True Self, feeling lighter and free. 

Throughout life, you will begin to look at everyday circumstances easily and meet surprises calmly and with grace. Answer the following in your notebook.

•Question No. 2: How much would your life improve if you lived with a light and carefree heart?

Live in unity

In today's meditation, we will talk about unity, as the basic truth of all that exists.

As individuals, we are not alike.  We have different lifestyles, beliefs and perceptions.

However, these differences exist only in the physical plane.

Whereas at the molecular and spiritual level, we are all one and are connected with the universal primary source.

When we begin to fully understand this concept of life in unity, the idea of a personal “I” gives way to the image of a universal “I”.

The concept of rivalry and competition disappears. 

This relationship contributes to deep love and empathy for everyone who surrounds us.

•QUESTION No. 1: How would you define unity?

•QUESTION No. 2: What do you think of diversity?

•QUESTION No. 3: How did meditation help you realize the idea of living in unity?

There was a king and he once said to the court sages: "I have a ring with one of the finest diamonds in the world and I want to inscript a message under the stone that can be useful in a situation of extreme despair. I will give this ring to my heirs and I want it to serve faithfully. Think of what kind of message will serve this purpose. It must be very short to fit in the ring."

The sages knew how to write treaties, but did not express themselves in one short sentence. They thought and thought, but could not come up with anything.

The king complained about the failure of his venture to a faithful old servant who raised him from infancy and was part of the family. 

And the old man said to him:
“I’m not a sage, I’m not educated, but I know such a message. For many years spent in the palace, I met a lot of people. And once I served a visiting mystic whom your father invited. And he gave me this message. Just don’t read it, pass it to the craftsman and only open it when there is no way out at all”.

The king listened to the old and faithful servant.

After some time, the enemies attacked the country and the king lost the war. He fled on his horse with the enemies in pursuit. He was alone, and there were many. He drove to the end of the road, only to arrive at a huge deep cliff before him.

If he fell there, it would be the end. He could not go back, the enemies were approaching, and he could already hear the clatter of their horses' hooves. He had no way out and he was in complete despair.

And then he remembered the ring. Recognising the time had come to look beneath the precious stone, he found an inscription: “This too shall pass.”

After reading the message, he felt that everything was quiet.

Apparently the pursuers got lost and proceeded in a different direction. Horses were no longer heard.

The king was filled with gratitude to the servant and the unknown mystic. Words were powerful. He put away the ring. And hit the road.  

Again he gathered his army and in due course returned to his palace and to power, and so arranged a magnificent feast for the whole kingdom - the people loved and celebrated their king. The king was happy and proud.

The old servant came up to him and in a soft tone urged him to “Look at the message again.”

"Now I am a winner, people are celebrating my return, I'm not in despair, not in a hopeless situation." Replied the King.

“Listen to the old servant,” he answered, “the message works not only in moments when everything is bad, but also in moments of victory.”

The king looked at the ring and discovered: "This too shall pass."

And again he felt a silence fall over him, although he was in the midst of a noisy dancing crowd. His pride dissolved. He understood the message. He was a wise man.

And then the old man said: “Do you remember everything that happened to you? Nothing and no feeling is permanent. As night changes into day, so moments of joy and despair replace each other. Accept them as the nature of things, as part of life”.

tasks[20] = `✨ Day 20 - Living Luxury ✨

*Task:*
Scroll through your  journal, read the tasks you've performed.

See if there is something that you missed or if you would you like to supplement anything in the light of your new awareness? 

After that, think about someone in your life and/or environment who seems to be unhappy. This person may complain often and have a generally negative view of life. 

Share the Fable from Day 19 with this person and write down what happens in your journal. 

How did you feel sharing the story with them? What thoughts, associations, sensations arose for you in the process? Did they answer? Did you talk about it, and of so what did you discuss?

*Message:*
“Live on the fat of the land.”

Today we look at the concept of luxury, adding to your life something that is much more significant than just a necessity.

When you feel that you are worthy to receive all the blessings that the Universe can offer you, your needs are satisfied easily and even more than necessary.  As soon as you learn to accept the grace that has been sent to you, you are showing the universe that you deserve only the best and are ready to receive it.

•QUESTION No. 1: How is luxury manifested in your life?

•QUESTION No. 2: What luxurious gifts do you present to yourself?

•QUESTION No. 3: How can you bring luxury to others?

*Phrase*
“Today I treat myself to moments of luxury.”

tasks[21] = `✨ Day 21 - Living Abundantly ✨

Here we are. Day 21 - the last day of this journey together. 

I am very thankful to have facilitated this group of intelligent, willing, conscious and self-aware people. You are all beautiful souls. Thank you for being in my life 🙏

*Message*
Are you familiar with the seven “switches” of happiness?

 🌟 Give to your neighbor
 🌟 Transmit [love & light]
 🌟 Let go [of things that do not serve you]
 🌟 Indulge [live life to the fullest]
 🌟 Give thanks
 🌟 Give yourself [be of service]
 🌟 Forgive

When these seven become part of your life, happiness will flow into it simply and easily.

Everything is energy and its flow must be circular and continuous in order to return abundance to you. This is how the law of reciprocity works.

Energy current ↔ influx/flow ↔ money/abundance

Keep your channels open and clean so that your energy can flow unhindered! Remember to stay present. 
This is YOUR time! 🙌

Your future is in your hands; you make choices and decisions every day, every moment.

How you use your time, with whom you spend it, and how you feel at every moment determines your life.

*Key Takeaways*
 🌸 Awareness
 🌸 Gratitude
 🌸 Recognition of value

Thank you for your participation, presence and energy invested in this process!
